## üìÅ Project Structure

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `train.py` | Main training loop for evolving bird agents. |
| `main_game.py` | Runs the best-performing trained bird model. |
| `bird.py` | Defines the Bird agent and its neural network. |
| `pipe.py` | Contains the Pipe object and collision logic. |
| `evolution.py` | Handles genetic algorithm: selection, crossover, mutation. |
| `inputs_fitness.py` | Extracts neural net inputs and computes fitness. |
| `config.py` | Global configuration (screen size, NN size, constants, etc). |
| `logger.py` | Logging and output tracking for training progress. |

## üß† Neural Network

Each bird is controlled by a simple feedforward neural network.

### Inputs to the Neural Network:
1. **Bird Y-position** (`bird_y`)  
2. **Bird Vertical Velocity** (`bird_velocity`)  
3. **Horizontal Distance to Next Pipe** (`pipe_dx`)  
4. **Vertical Distance to Pipe Gap Center** (`pipe_dy`)

### Output:
- A single float value.
- If `output > threshold` (e.g. 0.5), the bird flaps.

## üß¨ Genetic Algorithm Overview

The genetic algorithm evolves bird neural networks over generations.

### Steps:
- **Initialization**: Random neural networks
- **Fitness Evaluation**: Based on distance traveled and pipes passed
- **Selection**: Top performers become parents
- **Crossover**: Combine weights of parents
- **Mutation**: Add small random noise to offspring
